# GifsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Is a personal project to get a better knowledge about Angular.
In this project I fetch with the Gifphy App to give the users the gifs that they are looking for trough an input.

# Some extra implementation

- Lazy Loading Scroll [ ]
- Clean Data Button [x]
- Random Gifs Button [x]
- Deploy in Netlify [ ]

# A better way
- I would like to use a better structure of CSS with SASS and partitions, also a semanthic HTML. 
- Another point to review is turn the words that are in spanish into english.
- Maybe was better using @Output/@Input instead of @ViewChild
